auto-diagonalize
================

`auto-diagonalize' is an optimization pass written for LLVM.

Its purpose is to find loops that posess the characteristics of linear
dynamical systems, and replace them (if possible*) with a closed-form
representation of the system.

The goal is to be able to transform simple O(n) algorithms, such as the
iterative fibonacci number generator, into O(lg(n)) algorithms.

* The (n x n) transformation matrix of the system must have n eigenvectors.
